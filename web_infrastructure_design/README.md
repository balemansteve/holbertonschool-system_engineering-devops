# Web Infrastructure Design

Web infrastructure design involves planning and structuring the hardware, software, and network resources required to support web applications and services. It includes considerations for scalability, reliability, security, and performance to ensure a robust and efficient system.

# 1 Distributed web infrastructure
 A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a LAMP stack.

On a whiteboard, design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com. Start your explanation by having a user wanting to access your website.

Requirements:

You must use:
1 server
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 application files (your code base)
1 database (MySQL)
1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8
You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
What is a server
What is the role of the domain name
What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
What is the role of the web server
What is the role of the application server
What is the role of the database
What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
SPOF
Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
Please, remember that everything must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.

# 2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure

On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.

Requirements:

You must add:
3 firewalls
1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)
You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
For every additional element, why you are adding it
What are firewalls for
Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
What monitoring is used for
How the monitoring tool is collecting data
Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
Please, remember that everything must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.

#  3. Scale up

Readme

Application server vs web server
Requirements:

You must add:
1 server
1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as cluster with the other one
Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server
You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
For every additional element, why you are adding it
Please, remember that everything must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.
