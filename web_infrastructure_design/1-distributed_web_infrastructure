## Infrastructure Components

### 1. Load Balancer (HAProxy)

- **Purpose**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.
- **Distribution Algorithm**: Round-robin, which distributes client requests evenly across the servers.
- **Setup**: Active-Active, where both servers are actively handling traffic. This setup provides better load distribution and redundancy compared to Active-Passive, where one server is on standby.

### 2. Web Server (Nginx)

- **Purpose**: Handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
- **Setup**: Configured to serve static files and act as a reverse proxy to the application server.

### 3. Application Server

- **Purpose**: Runs the application code and processes dynamic requests.
- **Setup**: Hosts the application files and communicates with the database server to fetch or store data.

### 4. Database Server (MySQL)

- **Purpose**: Stores and manages the application's data.
- **Setup**: Configured as a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster to ensure data redundancy and high availability.

## Specifics

- **Primary-Replica Cluster**: The Primary node handles all write operations, while the Replica node handles read operations. This setup improves performance and provides data redundancy.
- **SPOF (Single Points of Failure)**: The load balancer and database primary node are potential SPOFs. If either fails, the entire system could be affected.

## Security Issues

- **No firewall**: The infrastructure is vulnerable to unauthorized access.
- **No HTTPS**: Data transmitted between clients and servers is not encrypted, making it susceptible to interception.
- **No Monitoring**: Without monitoring, it's challenging to detect and respond to issues in real-time.
