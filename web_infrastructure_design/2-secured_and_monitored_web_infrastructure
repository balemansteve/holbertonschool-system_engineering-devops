# Web Infrastructure Design for www.foobar.com

## Components:
1. **3 Web Servers**: Host website content and handle user requests.
2. **3 Firewalls**: Protect each web server by filtering traffic.
3. **1 Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across web servers.
4. **1 SSL Certificate**: Encrypts traffic between users and web servers.
5. **3 Monitoring Clients**: Collect data for monitoring services.

## Design:

### Explanation of Components:
- **Firewalls**: Protect web servers by filtering traffic, preventing unauthorized access.
- **HTTPS Traffic**: SSL certificate encrypts data between users and web servers.
- **Monitoring**: Collects performance and health data of web servers.
- **Monitoring Data Collection**: Tracks CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic.

### Monitoring QPS:
Configure monitoring clients to track web server requests over time. Visualize data in monitoring service dashboards.

### Issues with the Infrastructure:
- **SSL Termination at Load Balancer**: Traffic between load balancer and web servers is not encrypted.
- **Single MySQL Server for Writes**: Creates a single point of failure and limits scalability.
- **Homogeneous Servers**: Leads to resource contention and scaling difficulties.
